          I just watched an hour-long video by Veritasium with the thumbnail:
          "Effort is the Algorithm" and the title "What Everyone Gets Wrong
          About AI and Learning."
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          For quite a while now, I've been trying to understand how AI affects
          the way we learn and retain information. My curiosity has especially
          been around how it challenges traditional educational approaches to
          teaching and learning—especially now that everyone is using it.

          Key Insights from the Video
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If you don't have an hour to watch the video, here are some key points
          that stood out to me and helped answer some of my concerns:
        </p>
        <div className="pl-6">
          <p className="mb-4">
            - It's very easy to complain about the educational system. The
            reality, however, is that efforts have been made to transform
            education—from radio lessons, to television, to MOOCs, and now AI.
            Yet, it seems that not much has fundamentally changed from the
            traditional model, and in some cases, things may even be getting
            worse.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            - In the video, Veritasium discusses the two systems of thinking,
            inspired by the book "Thinking, Fast and Slow". These are:
          </p>
          <div className="pl-6">
            <p className="mb-4">
              System 1: The "fast system" that doesn't involve much effort and
              operates automatically.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              System 2: The "deliberate system" that takes the brute-force
              route—engaging deeply, thinking critically, and going through the
              stress of understanding details.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p className="mb-4">
            - To effectively learn and develop our cognitive abilities, we need
            to strengthen both systems. The traditional education system, in its
            own way, tries to do this. However, AI is beginning to remove that
            deliberate effort from our learning journeys—whether it's writing,
            coding, thinking, creating art, and so on.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            - That's the issue. To truly understand and master anything, we must
            go through a challenging and often frustrating phase. That's where
            long-lasting neural connections are formed in the brain. But AI is
            taking that struggle away, and that's extremely concerning. As
            Albert Einstein once said, "Education is not the learning of facts,
            but the training of the mind to think." So, if we stop thinking and
            start delegating that thinking to AI—what happens next? Hmm.

          I'm a strong advocate for AI, and to be honest, AI isn't the
          problem—it's the way we use it. I won't list all the benefits of AI
          because they're obvious
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          What I would recommend is that every university should create a
          mandatory course "The Effective Use of AI in Learning and Retention of
          Information."

          Moving forward, my approach to AI will be completely different.
