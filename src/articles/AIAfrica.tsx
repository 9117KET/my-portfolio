        The fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Big Data, and the Internet
        of Things (IoT) has been transforming industries globally, and Africa is
        no different. Below is a historical timeline of AI, IoT and Big Data
        over 6 decades.

        <p>
          The development and progress of AI, IoT and Big data has been around
          for a while now, but the realization of its potential made waves
          globally after the launch of Chat GPT by Open AI which showcased the
          potential of AI and gave everyone a chance to experiment with AI. The
          results have been phenomenal.

          My motivation for writing this article
        </h2>
        <p>
          My motivation for writing this article came after noticing the gap in
          technological adoption between developed and developing regions, Africa has the lowest developmental
          and adoption rates compared to all other continents in the world, and
          this is a huge problem given that Africa has one of the
          fastest-growing economies. By 2035, Africa will have the youngest and
          largest workforce in the world and will be home to many individuals.

          Kigali as the main point of focus
        </h2>
        <p>
          While it is practically impossible to address the entire African
          continent in this article, my focus will be Rwanda, with my case study
          being the Kigali Innovation City (KIC). Kigali has been commonly
          referred to as the Silicon Valley of Africa and this has been thanks
          to the enormous to the efforts put in place by the government to
          ensure the advancement of technology in all domains. For instance, the
          Vision 2050 strategy outlines Rwanda's commitment to "becoming a
          proof-of-concept destination and living laboratory" with huge and
          impactful projects like the KIC.

          Potential of IoT, AI and Big Data in Rwanda (Africa)
        </h2>
        <p>
          Though this article is focused on Rwanda, I would like to point out
          that this is applicable to almost all African countries.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Rwanda's government and private sector are leveraging IoT, AI, and Big
          Data to address challenges in healthcare, e-governance, education, and
          agriculture. The national AI policy, in partnership with the World
          Economic Forum, aims to establish Rwanda as a technology leader in
          Africa.

      {/* Challenges */}
      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-400">
          Challenges of Integrating AI, IoT, and Big Data in Africa
        </h2>
        <p>
          Several challenges impede the adoption of these technologies in
          Africa, including an unreliable power supply, high connectivity costs,
          brain drain due to the lack of the infrastructure to implement such
          ideas and technology, and limited funding from VCs in and out of
          Africa. KIC addresses these challenges by partnering with
          organizations like Africa50, the Rwanda Development Board and
          establishing universities and technological projects that ensures a
          sustainable adoption of these technologies and much more.

          Conclusion
        </h2>
        <p>
          As Rwanda continues to embrace AI, IoT, and Big Data, there is immense
          potential for growth and development not only in Rwanda but the entire
          African continent. Stakeholders, VCs, and investors are encouraged to
          invest in the future through Africa.
