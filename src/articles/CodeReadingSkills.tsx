        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          As a computer science student, I often see discussions about how AI
          might change programming. While some worry about AI replacing
          programmers, I've found that AI tools actually help me learn faster
          and understand code better. What's really interesting is that as AI
          helps generate code more quickly, the ability to read and debug code
          becomes even more important. Through my learning journey, I've
          discovered that being able to understand and fix code is just as
          crucial as writing it. In this article, I want to share what I've
          learned about developing these essential skills.

        <h2>Why Code Reading and Debugging Matter</h2>

        <h3>1. Learning from Existing Code</h3>
        <p>
          When I first started programming, I realized that reading other
          people's code is one of the best ways to learn. It's like having a
          conversation with more experienced programmers. Here's what I've found
          helpful:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Understanding different coding styles and patterns used by
            experienced developers
          </li>
          <li>Learning how to spot common mistakes and potential issues</li>
          <li>
            Discovering new ways to solve problems I hadn't thought of before
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Debugging as a Learning Tool</h3>
        <p>
          One of my biggest "aha" moments was realizing that debugging isn't
          just about fixing errors - it's about understanding how code actually
          works. When I debug code, I learn:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>How different parts of a program interact with each other</li>
          <li>What happens when things go wrong and why</li>
          <li>How to think systematically about solving problems</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Developing Code Reading and Debugging Skills</h2>

        <h3>1. Starting Small and Building Up</h3>
        <p>Here's the approach that's helped me improve:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Begin with small, well-documented projects - they're easier to
            understand
          </li>
          <li>Try to predict what the code will do before running it</li>
          <li>Use print statements or debuggers to trace the program flow</li>
          <li>
            Make small changes and see what happens - it's like experimenting!
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Understanding Different Types of Code</h3>
        <p>
          I've learned that code can be read at different levels, like looking
          at a building:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>High-level: Understanding the overall purpose and structure</li>
          <li>Mid-level: Seeing how different parts work together</li>
          <li>Low-level: Looking at the specific details and logic</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Tools That Help</h3>
        <p>These tools have been game-changers in my learning process:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Debuggers that let me step through code line by line</li>
          <li>
            Print statements to understand what's happening at different points
          </li>
          <li>Version control to see how code changes over time</li>
          <li>Online resources and documentation to understand new concepts</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Practical Exercises That Helped Me</h2>

        <h3>1. The Debugging Challenge</h3>
        <p>Here's an exercise that really helped me improve:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Find a small program with known bugs</li>
          <li>
            Try to predict where the bugs might be before looking at the code
          </li>
          <li>Use debugging tools to track down the issues</li>
          <li>Fix the bugs and explain why they occurred</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Code Reading Practice</h3>
        <p>
          These activities have helped me become better at understanding code:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reading and explaining code to classmates or study partners</li>
          <li>Participating in code review sessions with peers</li>
          <li>Working on open-source projects with good documentation</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Building a Learning Routine</h2>
        <p>Here's what's worked for me in developing these skills:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Set aside time each week to read and understand new code</li>
          <li>
            Practice debugging by intentionally introducing and fixing bugs
          </li>
          <li>Join coding communities where you can learn from others</li>
          <li>
            Keep a learning journal of interesting code patterns and solutions
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          As a student learning to program, I've discovered that being able to
          read and debug code is just as important as writing it. These skills
          have helped me learn faster, understand concepts better, and become
          more confident in my programming abilities. What's exciting is that
          these skills keep improving with practice, just like learning how to
          play an instrument - every time I read or debug code, I learn
          something new. Whether you're just starting out or have been
          programming for a while, I hope these insights from my learning
          journey help you develop these essential skills too. Remember, every
          line of code you read and every bug you fix is a step forward in your
          programming journey!
